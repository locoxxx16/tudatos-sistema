The AI engineer successfully built upon the initial MVP, addressing critical backend and frontend issues, then significantly expanded data handling and initiated UI enhancements. The process began by resolving a  dependency error in the backend, followed by a duplicate  component definition in . After fixing these, the engineer focused on new user requirements: implementing robust Daticos.com data extraction using provided credentials (Saraya/12345), debugging complex login flows, and creating a data integrator. A daily automatic update system was designed and integrated into . The engineer then clarified deployment options (Emergent vs. external hosting) and, upon user's choice, prepared the application for Emergent deployment, confirming its functionality. The most recent efforts revolve around completely overhauling the frontend UI, specifically making all menu search options and admin panel features fully functional and mirroring Daticos.com's original behavior by creating and integrating dedicated React components for individual, massive, and special queries in .

The goal is to evolve a React/FastAPI/MongoDB data platform, initially mirroring Daticos.com, into a comprehensive search and analysis tool. The app currently has a working login (admin/admin123), a Daticos-like UI, and sample Costa Rican data.
Key requirements include:
- **Data Expansion:** Extract all data from Daticos.com (using Amonge/Dinero25, and later Saraya/12345 credentials) and Crediserver.net. Enrich this with information from Google Maps (phone numbers), Ministry of Finance (legal representatives), National Registry (assets), and fully integrate Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) data. Data should include detailed mercantile, marriage, labor, credit, vehicle, property, and company information.
- **Administration Panel:** Develop a comprehensive admin panel for data visualization, management, user access control, and customization (branding removal, payment option disabling). Every configuration option must have a determined action.
- **Functionality:** Implement robust query options for all menu items (individual, massive, special queries), supporting massive and filtered searches with complete information, mirroring Daticos.com's search functionality and improving upon it.
- **Operational Requirements:** Activate a daily system for continuous data updates and enrichment. Provide guidance on domain transfer and data export. The project needs to be deployable for 24/7 access, with the user explicitly choosing Emergent Deploy.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **FastAPI**: Python web framework for backend APIs.
- **React**: JavaScript library for frontend UI development.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage.

- ****: Python library for in-process task scheduling (daily updates).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a full-stack architecture with separate backend (FastAPI) and frontend (React) services, supported by a MongoDB database.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep into enhancing the frontend user interface and ensuring every menu option and administration panel feature has functional capabilities, replicating the exact behavior of Daticos.com.

The previous work involved:
1.  **Backend Login Fix:** Resolved a backend login error by adding  to .
2.  **Frontend Compilation Fix:** Addressed a frontend compilation issue by removing a duplicate  component definition in .
3.  **Admin Panel Integration (Initial):** Integrated the admin panel by updating  in  to include an Admin link and modifying  to display the .
4.  **Daticos Data Extraction:** Successfully debugged and implemented Daticos.com login using new user credentials (Saraya/12345), created  to pull data across various query types (396 records extracted).
5.  **Data Integration:** Created  to process and add extracted Daticos data (199 persons) to the MongoDB database.
6.  **Daily Auto-Updater:** Developed  and integrated it into  to ensure continuous data updates.
7.  **Deployment Preparation:** Discussed deployment options with the user and, upon user's selection, confirmed the application's readiness for Deploy on Emergent, ensuring backend and frontend functionality.

The **current focus** is on the frontend, specifically:
-   Improving the overall appearance of the menu.
-   Making **all search options** fully functional, mimicking Daticos.com's search capabilities.
-   Ensuring **every configuration option in the admin panel** has a precise, determined action.

The engineer has started this by:
-   Creating new functional React components for Individual Queries (e.g., , , , ) and replacing the generic  with a  that handles rendering these. This was done by modifying .
-   Creating new functional React components for Massive Queries (e.g., , , , , ). This involved replacing the Results Display Component section in  with .
-   Updating the  function within the  component in  to correctly render these newly created components based on the active menu item.

The work is progressing by building out the specific UI components and their logic for each search type. The product is functional for individual and massive queries, but the Special Queries and the admin panel's full functionality are still in progress.
