The AI engineer successfully initiated a Daticos data platform replication, then shifted focus to expanding data sources and building a comprehensive administration panel. The process involved identifying and fixing a critical backend login error (missing  dependency), followed by resolving a frontend compilation issue caused by a duplicate  component definition in . The AI methodically analyzed the frontend code, located the duplicate, and corrected it. Concurrently, it began integrating the administration panel by modifying frontend navigation and routing. The engineer meticulously addressed user requests, breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps, demonstrating a clear understanding of the existing codebase and the user's evolving demands for a more robust and customizable platform. Key actions included dependency management, backend health checks, and targeted frontend UI/component refactoring.

<product_requirements>
The core objective is to develop a robust data search and analysis platform, initially mirroring Daticos.com, and then significantly enhancing its database and functionality. The application, built with React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), and MongoDB (database), currently features a functional login (admin/admin123), a Daticos-like UI, and sample Costa Rican data.

**Key Requirements & Enhancements:**
- **Data Expansion:** Extract all data from Daticos.com (using provided Amonge/Dinero25 credentials) and Crediserver.net. Enrich data with information from Google Maps (phone numbers), Ministry of Finance (legal representatives), and National Registry (assets), and fully integrate Supreme Electoral Tribunal (TSE) data.
- **Administration Panel:** Develop a comprehensive admin panel for data visualization, management, user access control, and customization (removing Daticos branding/logo, disabling payment options).
- **Functionality:** Implement robust query options for all menu items, supporting massive and filtered searches with complete information. Ensure continuous data updates and enrichment.
- **Operational Requirements:** Establish systems for continuous application functionality and auto-generation of updates. Provide guidance on domain transfer and receiving email notifications for app updates/improvements, and enable data export to user's email.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
- **FastAPI**: Python web framework for backend APIs.
- **React**: JavaScript library for frontend UI development.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database.
- **Motor**: Asynchronous Python driver for MongoDB.
- ****: HTTP client for asynchronous requests (identified as a missing dependency).
- **UUIDs**: Used for unique identifiers (JSON serialization compatibility).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application employs a full-stack architecture with clear separation between backend and frontend services.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on resolving critical application issues and advancing the comprehensive administration panel. Initially, a backend login error was identified and fixed by adding the missing  dependency to  and reinstalling packages. After confirming backend login functionality, the focus shifted to the frontend, where a compilation error was discovered:  was declared twice in .

The AI engineer systematically debugged this by:
1.  Inspecting console logs and screenshots to identify the  declaration conflict.
2.  Searching  to locate both  definitions.
3.  Determining the ranges of each duplicate component.
4.  Deciding to remove the first  definition (lines 1610-1989) and retain the second one.

Following the fix for the duplicate component, the AI began integrating the admin panel into the application's navigation and routing:
1.  The  array in the  component within  was updated to replace Precios y Planes with a new Admin menu item.
2.  The  function in the  component within  was modified to conditionally render the  when the 'admin' menu item is active.

The product is currently in a state where backend login issues are resolved, and the frontend is being refactored to correctly display and route to the new administration panel. The immediate next step is to verify these frontend changes.

Restart the frontend to apply the recent changes and verify the compilation error is fixed and the admin panel is accessible via navigation.
