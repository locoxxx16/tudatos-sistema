The previous AI engineer diligently addressed critical Vercel deployment failures (404/500) caused by excessive package size. Initial efforts involved optimizing the  file and streamlining the application for serverless deployment using , successfully reducing the deployment size from ~440MB to 12KB, enabling a basic functional deployment.

Following this, the focus shifted to re-integrating the full application functionality, specifically the 5.9M+ record MongoDB database. The core challenge became establishing a suitable cloud MongoDB hosting solution, as the local MongoDB setup was incompatible with Vercel. Multiple attempts with MongoDB Atlas and DigitalOcean failed due to region-specific billing restrictions and payment card acceptance issues (Costa Rica). The AI engineer systematically guided the user through alternative hosting options, ultimately recommending Railway as the most reliable solution for the user's specific payment constraints. The current state is poised to set up MongoDB on Railway.

The application aims to be Costa Rica's leading data search and analysis tool, surpassing competitors like Daticos.com. This requires a database exceeding 5 million records, integrated from diverse Costa Rican sources (Sicop, Ministry of Finance, National Registry, TSE). Key features include automated daily updates via an AI-driven automatic improvement process, 24/7 resilience, and a frontend displaying comprehensive user/company data (emails, phones, family, credit, mercantile, social media, employment, photos) upon search. An administrative panel is needed for data visualization, user management (creation, deletion, password, email), and branding customization, with payment functionalities removed. User registration with credit plans and email notifications is implemented. The immediate past priority was comprehensive enterprise and juridical data extraction, which is completed on the backend.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a FastAPI backend and React frontend with MongoDB.



-   ****: The primary FastAPI application. It was refactored for Vercel compatibility, integrated  for large datasets, implemented Ultra Complete Search, user registration, and a single-session authentication system. Recent changes include  for extractors and HTML templating fixes.
-   ****: A Vercel-specific entry point, previously importing , now simplified to import  for a lighter application.
-   ****: Manages unified data access from multiple MongoDB collections. Modified to resolve  conflicts and provide accurate real-time record counts (5.9M+).
-   ****: *NEW*. A lightweight FastAPI application, created to optimize for Vercel by stripping heavy logic.
-   ****: *NEW, Modified*. An even more minimalist FastAPI application, initially intended as a single file with embedded HTML and minimal dependencies for Vercel. It was recently modified to include MongoDB connection logic for the full application.
-   ****: *NEW*. A pared-down  with essential dependencies for Vercel deployments (e.g., , , , ).
-   ****: Stores , which was updated to the external preview URL to resolve frontend-backend connectivity issues.
-   ****: Vercel deployment configuration, continuously modified to adapt routing and build processes, most recently pointing to .
-   ****: *NEW, Modified*. Crucial for Vercel deployment. Initially introduced to ignore large files. It was extensively refined to exclude , , log files, and  to reduce deployment size from ~440MB to 12KB, resolving  errors.
-   ****: *NEW*. A Python script prepared for migrating the 5.9M+ local MongoDB records to a cloud MongoDB Atlas instance.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Establish a suitable cloud MongoDB instance (Railway is the current proposed solution) to host the 5.9M+ records.
-   Migrate the existing local MongoDB data (2.32 GB) to the newly configured cloud MongoDB instance.
-   Configure the Vercel deployment to connect to the new cloud MongoDB instance using the correct  environment variable.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully resolved the critical Vercel deployment issues. The application's core logic, Ultra Complete Search, auto-regeneration, user registration, and single-session authentication are confirmed operational locally.

The Vercel deployment now successfully deploys a minimalist version (via ) with a total size of 12KB, confirming that the packaging issues (excessive file size from , , logs, ) have been resolved.

The current focus is on migrating the 5,947,607 real records (totaling 2.32 GB) from the local MongoDB to a cloud-hosted solution so the full application functionality can be deployed on Vercel. Attempts to set up MongoDB Atlas (M10 plan) failed due to a region-specific billing restriction and then general credit card acceptance issues with Costa Rican cards. A subsequent attempt with DigitalOcean Managed MongoDB also failed for the same payment reason. The AI engineer has identified Railway as the next viable MongoDB hosting option, as it is known to accept international cards, including those from Costa Rica, and offers competitive pricing. The user has agreed to proceed with Railway.
