The previous AI engineer successfully stabilized and significantly expanded the application from MVP to a robust, feature-rich system. Initial efforts involved resolving critical Vercel deployment issues by meticulously refactoring  and configuring  to manage eager loading and  conflicts. Subsequently, the database was scaled from 5,000 to over 4.2 million real records through the integration of multiple MongoDB collections via . Key functionalities such as an Ultra Complete Search, a user registration system with email notifications, and an automated auto-regeneration system were then implemented. The most recent and significant task, as per the user's shifted priority, was the implementation of comprehensive enterprise and juridical data extraction. This involved creating and populating  and , and integrating six new API endpoints into . Extensive backend testing confirmed the successful operation of these new features, extracting data for over 20,000 companies. The previous engineer declared this mission completed, documenting all progress in .

<product_requirements>
The core product goal is to establish Costa Rica's leading data search and analysis tool, surpassing existing solutions like Daticos.com. This requires expanding the database significantly to 3-5 million+ records (currently 4.2 million+) by integrating diverse Costa Rican data sources (e.g., Sicop, Ministry of Finance, National Registry, TSE, COSEVI, Portal Datos Abiertos, Colegios Profesionales) using ultra aggressive and deep extraction methodologies. The system must support automated daily updates via an AI-driven automatic improvement process and maintain 24/7 resilience. The frontend is required to display comprehensive data (emails, phones, family, credit, mercantile, social media, employment, photos) upon search queries. An administrative panel is essential for data visualization, user management (creation, deletion, password, email), and branding customization, with payment functionalities explicitly removed. User registration with credit plans and email notifications (to ) has been implemented. The immediate focus, now completed, was on extracting comprehensive enterprise and juridical data, including company ownership and participants, from sources like Sicop and the Ministry of Finance, running all extractors at maximum performance.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully concluded the implementation of a high-priority directive: expanding the application's data pool with comprehensive **enterprise and juridical data**. The system was already fully operational with over 4.2 million records, an Ultra Complete Search feature, an automated daily auto-regeneration system, and a complete user registration system including email notifications.

The recently completed work includes:
1.  **Enterprise Data Extraction Logic**: The file  was fully implemented to extract data for over 20,000 companies from five distinct sources: SICOP, Ministry of Finance, Registro Nacional, MEIC, and CCSS. This extraction includes detailed information such as legal representatives, comprehensive participant lists, detailed shareholder structures, public contracts, and tax-related data.
2.  **Master Extractor Controller**: The  was developed to manage and optimize the execution of all data extractors. It ensures parallel processing, allows control over extractor concurrency (up to 5 extractors), and provides real-time statistics and advanced logging.
3.  **New API Endpoints**: Six new API endpoints were integrated into the main backend server via  to expose the functionalities of the new enterprise extraction and the master controller. These endpoints are: , , , , , and .

Backend tests confirmed that all these new functionalities are working correctly. The system currently holds 4,283,709 base records, and the new enterprise system is ready to extract more data, moving towards the 5M+ records goal. The admin login credentials () are confirmed to be functional. All work, including the new features, was meticulously documented and updated in . The previous engineer declared the implementation of the enterprise system completed.
