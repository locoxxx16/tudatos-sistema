The AI engineer's trajectory shows a persistent effort to deploy a Python FastAPI backend application with a React frontend, initially to Railway.app and then pivoting to Vercel, while also expanding data extraction capabilities. Key challenges included user's difficulty with GitHub and Railway UI, and subsequently, Vercel's specific requirements for Python applications. The engineer made multiple attempts to guide the user through GitHub repository setup, Railway deployment, and Vercel configuration. The core problem evolved from initial data extraction and scheduling setup to critical deployment issues, particularly managing environment configurations and dependencies for serverless platforms. The engineer simplified the  and  to overcome Vercel's  errors.

The objective is to evolve a React/FastAPI/MongoDB Daticos.com mirror into a comprehensive search and analysis tool. This entails expanding data to 3-5 million+ records from Daticos.com (using Saraya/12345 and CABEZAS/Hola2022 credentials), Crediserver.net, Google Maps, Ministry of Finance, National Registry, TSE data, COSEVI, Portal Datos Abiertos, and Colegios Profesionales, strictly filtered for Costa Rican entities. The system requires an ultra aggressive and deep extraction method, automated daily extraction at 5 AM with AI-driven automatic improvement, and operational resilience for 24/7 hosting. Frontend functionality needs enhancement to display all comprehensive information on search result clicks. A full admin panel for data visualization, management, user access, and branding customization (removing payment methods) is also required. Current progress includes 310,840 records, multiple aggressive backend extractors (Ultra Deep, Mega Aggressive, V2.0 Ultra Optimized + IA), and a monitor script.

<code_architecture>
The application comprises a FastAPI backend, a React frontend, and a MongoDB database. The core logic resides in the  directory, while deployment configurations are in the root and  directories.



-   **/app/backend/requirements.txt**:
    -   **Summary**: Defines Python dependencies.
    -   **Changes**: Initially contained extensive libraries. Most recently, it was drastically simplified to only  and  to resolve Vercel deployment issues, as heavy dependencies caused .
-   **/app/backend/server.py**:
    -   **Summary**: The main FastAPI application. Handles API endpoints, search queries, and integrated extractors.
    -   **Changes**: Expanded with new endpoints for , , , and . During Vercel deployment troubleshooting, it was simplified to a minimal version with only , , and  endpoints, removing problematic imports and complex logic to achieve a functional deployment.
-   **/app/backend/portal_datos_abiertos_extractor.py**:
    -   **Summary**: Newly created file intended for extracting data from Portal Datos Abiertos.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Full Data Extraction from Additional Sources:** Implement extractors for Crediserver.net, Google Maps, Ministry of Finance.
-   **Comprehensive Admin Panel:** Complete backend/frontend for data visualization, management, user access, and branding customization.
-   **Payment Method Removal:** Eliminate payment methods UI/logic.
-   **Advanced Query Functionality:** Implement full search, filtering, and massive query options for Special Queries, including photo queries.
-   **Frontend All Information Display:** Implement the new component in  to show all available data on clicking a search result.
-   **Restore full  and  functionality on Vercel:** Re-introduce removed logic and dependencies after core deployment is stable.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was deep into troubleshooting Vercel deployment issues. The user had successfully deployed the project to Vercel, but it resulted in a  error and subsequent  errors, indicating the Python backend was not running correctly.

The engineer identified two main problems:
1.  **Vercel's initial misinterpretation**: Vercel detected the project as a frontend due to the  directory, causing incorrect build and routing. This was addressed by creating  in the root directory to explicitly define the Python backend and its routing:
    
2.  **Backend Runtime Errors**: Even with , the application crashed due to missing imports (, , ) in  that were not present in the GitHub repository, and heavy dependencies in  incompatible with Vercel's serverless environment.

To resolve these, the engineer simplified  to a minimal functional FastAPI app with basic health and stats endpoints:

And then, critically, simplified  to only include  and  to remove problematic dependencies. The user has just confirmed they made this final change to .
